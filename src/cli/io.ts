 * with EPIPE (ENOTCONN when stdout is a socket whose peer has gone, as when a Node
 * parent spawns the CLI with piped stdio on macOS). That is ordinary use, so the

 * `tagesschau.output` (`Could not write to stdout: <message>`, through `log`, in the
 * run's format) and exits 1. On stderr an EPIPE is ignored, so a failed run keeps its
 * exit code; any other stderr error exits 1 silently (there is nowhere left to report
 * it). The bin shim installs this once, before `run()`, with a logger for the format
 * argv asks for (`processLogger`); without one, records are text on `streams.stderr`.
